title: "About Pep/10"
description: "An overview of Pep/10, a 16-bit CISC architecture introduced in the 6th edition of Computer Systems. It covers its new IDE, designed for multi-platform use, as well as its instruction set, addressing modes, and the roles of its registers, emphasizing its educational purpose in teaching computer architecture and assembly language."
---

- Pep/10 is the new architecture for upcoming Computer Systems, 6th edition (CS6E), with some major changes over [Pep/9](https://github.com/StanWarford/pep9suite) and [Computer Systems, 5th edition](https://computersystemsbook.com/)
  - Both have companion software to allow students to write & debug assembly language programs
  - CS6E will come with a [new IDE](https://github.com/Matthew-McRaven/Pepp) running on Win/Mac/Linux/[WASM](https://compsys-pep.com/), containing tools for Pep/10, Pep/9, and Pep/8; I can finally stop maintaining CS4/5E software
- 16-bit CISC ISA used to teach computer architecture & assembly language to undergraduates
  - Designed for easy hand translation from C to assembly
- [Accumulator machine](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(computing)#Accumulator_machines>) with 1 general purpose register and 5 special registers. See register descriptions in the Registers section
- Unary instructions do not access memory and only operate directly on registers
- Non-unary instructions contain a extra 16-bit operand, which is interpreted using one of 8 addressing modes
- With only 1 GP register, `C` operations like `B, A = A, B` need extra temporary variables in memory
- Uses [memory-mapped IO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)
  - Read and write specific memory addresses for stdin, stdout rather than accessing files

## Registers

| Register              | Short Name | Special or General? | Usage                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accumulator           | `A`        | General             | Destination register for most instructions                                                                                 |
| Index                 | `X`        | General-ish         | Offsets for some addressing modes; alternative destination register                                                        |
| Stack Pointer         | `SP`       | Special             | Contains the current stack pointer, implicitly modified by instructions `CALL` and `RET`                                   |
| Program Counter       | `PC`       | Special             | Contains the address of the next instruction to execute. Modified with control flow mnemonics like `BR`, `CALL`, and `RET` |
| Instruction Specifier | `IS`       | Special             | Contains the current opcode. Not accessible by the user                                                                    |
| Operand Specifier     | `OS`       | Special             | Contains the opcode's argument if it is non-unary. Not accessible by the user                                              |

## Addressing Modes

| Addressing Mode         | `aaa`-field | `a`-field | Letters | Operand                 | Commonly used to Access...                                         |
